Projects:

* arduino-portal:
JQuery and PHP are used to communicate with an Arduino through serial port.

Several buttons are present on web site:
- green ones: order Arduino to play a sound with buzzer (keyboard: wxcvbn,;)
- blue ones: order Arduino to switch on/switch off/toggle led (keyboard: 12~)
- red one: order Arduino to get temperature (keyboard t)

For now, the Arduino code is not added but could be in a next Git repo.

* webgl:
JQuery, Javascript and WebGL are used to draw a 3D scene.

The scene is firstly empty, you can add objects in the scene with the following parameters:
- x, y and z positions in the scene
- size
- type: cube or sphere

The arrow keys allow to make the meshes rotate, the f keyboard key allows to switch between several texture renderings.
The scene can be zoomed down or up (Page Up/Page Down) and dragged and dropped with the mouse.

classes:
- Buffer: load buffer and textures used for meshes
- Mesh: object from the scene which has own position and rotating speed

shaders:
vertex.shdr: used for vertex positions and lighting
fragment.shdr: used for colors and blending
